Currently I am a Ph.D. Student from University of Southern California, Department of Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Chao Wang](https://sites.usc.edu/chaowang/).

I got my Bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2023. I am generally interested in **Program Analysis and Verification**, especially on algebraic tools and its theoretical aspect.
