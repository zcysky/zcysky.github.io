**Organizer:** Chenyu Zhou (czhou691@usc.edu)  
**Involved Faculty:** Chao Wang (wang626@usc.edu), Jingbo Wang (wang6203@purdue.edu)

## Introduction
Starting from 2024 Fall, our PLFM reading group will focus more on Programming Languages and corresponding Formal Methods. The topics in which we are interested include but are not limited to the following list:

### 1. Programming Language:
- Program Analysis and Abstract Interpretation
- Type Theory and Type System
- Program Synthesis
- Quantitative and Probabilistic Program Analysis

### 2. Formal Verification:
- Program Verification
- Neural Network Verification
- Model Checking and Automata Theory
- Theorem Provers

### 3. Intersection with Other Topics:
- **With Computer System**: Concurrency, Distributed System, Trusted Execution Environment...
- **With Computer Security**: Side Channel, Bug Detection...
- **With Theoretical Computer Science(Theory A)**: Computational Complexity, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Game Theory...
- **With Quantum Information**: Quantum Programming Language, Quantum Program Synthesis...

The list above is tentative and is subject to change based on everyone's interest. Each week, we will focus on one/a portion of a literature. We will have one moderator who leads through the paper, and we recommend everyone interested in the topic to read through the corresponding paper prior to the reading group. Optionally, we can also include presentations.

## Content:
### 2024 Fall
1. **Kleene Algebra with Tests and Algebraic Program Analysis** 
2. **OOPSLA 2024 Conference Paper Recommendation**
3. **Symbolic Execution and Paths**

## How to Participate
We provide hybrid (onsite at USC UPC Campus, PHE 316 + Zoom) participation for our reading group (the location will change after USC CS Department move to new GCS Building), and welcome students from USC and other institutes working on related area to join us!

If you want to join, please send an email to Chenyu including your personal information. After confirming your information, we will add you to the mail list.
