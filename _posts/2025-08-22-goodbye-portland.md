**I may write more things here in future. So many things to say!**

Portland is a quite, beautiful city lying on the intersection of two rivers. Previously I didn't get a clear idea about Portland or even the Oregon state. Though I have attended OPLSS, but that's the only year it's held in Boston (which is really funny ---- the first time I visited the University of Oregon is the day I drove past Eugene on I-5).

I can still remember I was a bit nervous at the first day, as I haven't interned in such a big company. Luckily all the people are nice there: my manager Joey welcomed me; other interns quickly created a group chat and started chatting; Bill invited us to the 'Portland food' doc; we went out for lunch at Pioneer Square for the first time(and keep doing that for the rest of the summer ---- but trying different places!).

It's lucky to have these people as friends and we actually did many interesting things together, from the talk show to the waterfalls and the bowling balls, it's really a good experience that everyone here is interesting, nice and friendly. Recalling the experiences and things happening in these days in really like a dream. 

Besides that, Portland is beautiful with delicious food, amazing natural scenes, good weathers and nice people. It's definitely a great place for summer. 

Though my internship hasn't ended, but it's time for me to leave Portland. I will always remember these days in Portland, and let me thank again the amazing people I met in Portland: Joey, Bill, Patrick, Daniel, Muqsit, Cayden, Amanda and David. Thank you all for the summer!
